### About Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In essence, machine learning algorithms use data to detect patterns, make predictions, or make decisions, often with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into several types, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. 

### Project1 Description. 
- Project Name: **RETAIL SALES FORECASTING AND PROFIT ANALYSIS SYSTEM.**
- Abstract: The project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting sales profitability in a retail company. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model integrates diverse factors including customer demographics, product categories, sales quantities, discounts, and shipping modes to predict profit margins accurately. By optimizing pricing strategies and identifying cost-saving opportunities, the model empowers retail companies to enhance revenue generation and streamline inventory management. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and rigorous model training, the project achieves robust predictive capabilities. Evaluation metrics validate model performance, ensuring reliability in profit prediction. The project underscores the pivotal role of predictive analytics in driving strategic decision-making and operational efficiency within the retail sector, contributing to sustainable growth and competitive advantage.

### Project2 Description. 
- Project Name: **NBA PLAYER PERFORMANCE PREDICTION.**
- This project endeavors to explore the realm of sports analytics by leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast the impact of NBA players based on their performance statistics. In the modern era of professional basketball, data-driven insights play a pivotal role in strategic decision-making for teams and individual players alike.
- The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle.com and contains detailed statistics and performance metrics of NBA players during basketball games. After importing essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, initial steps involved understanding the dataset's structure, dimensions, and data types.
- In the preprocessing phase, columns with over 60% null values were dropped, as they held little relevance for the machine learning model. Subsequently, rows containing any remaining null values were removed to maintain data integrity. The 'minutes' column, initially presented as an object, was converted to float for accurate analysis and model compatibility. Furthermore, the 'points' column underwent correction using the appropriate formula. A target variable, 'modified plus minus point,' was engineered for the model. The dataset size decreased from 645,953 rows and 29 columns to 516,595 rows and 27 columns after preprocessing, reflecting the removal of irrelevant and erroneous data, and the optimization of features for model training and analysis.
- In the data analysis phase, various insights were extracted from the preprocessed dataset to understand player performance and its impact. The analysis encompassed exploratory data visualization, statistical summaries, and correlation assessments. Key aspects such as team-wise performance, player statistics, and point contributions were investigated to identify trends and patterns. Visualizations including bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps were utilized to highlight significant relationships and distributions within the data. This analysis aided in finalizing the features needed for the machine learning model.
- Following data analysis, a function was developed to compute the career statistics of NBA players based on inputting their names. The function assesses various performance metrics throughout a player's career.
- After finalizing the dataset for the machine learning model, which included columns such as MIN, FGM, FG3M, FTM, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TO, PF, PTS, and MODIFIED_PLUS_MINUS, I plotted the correlation matrix to understand the relationships between these features. Following this, I performed train-test split and applied logistic regression to the data. Analyzing the weights of each feature provided insight into their importance in predicting player impact. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 62% on both training and testing data. Further evaluation through classification reports and confusion matrices confirmed the model's performance. I saved the trained logistic regression model using pickle for future use and applied it to predict player performance. To ensure logistic regression was the optimal choice for the classification problem, I also applied the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which yielded an accuracy of around 56%. This comparison highlighted the superiority of logistic regression for our classification task.
- The project aimed to leverage NBA player performance data to predict player impact through machine learning. By analyzing player statistics and applying classification models, we sought to uncover patterns and trends indicative of player contributions on the court.

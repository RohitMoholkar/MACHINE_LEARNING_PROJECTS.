## I have included Machine Learning Projects covering Regression, Classification, and more using Python in this Repository. 

### About Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In essence, machine learning algorithms use data to detect patterns, make predictions, or make decisions, often with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into several types, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.
